# SpectralMethods
A collection of spectral methods implemented in Python. Active work in progress - may not compile or work as intended until first finished version.

* JEMScolbrook - methods implemented from "The foundations of spectral computations via the Solvability Complexity Index hierarchy" by Colbrook and Hansen (2022). 
* MatrixClasses - classes of matrices implemented as callables
